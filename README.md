# Balanced Dice

:warning: WIP :warning:

This is Library that uses a deck of cards to simulate two 6 sided dice being rolled.

Methodology used to balanced out result involves calculating probability for multiples of same rolls in a short period and resetting and shuffling the deck every 13 draw.

Heres is the reference I followed in implementation: [Colonist.io - Designing Balanced Dice](https://blog.colonist.io/designing-balanced-dice/)
